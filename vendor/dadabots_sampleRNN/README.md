# Dadabots SampleRNN 
## Generating Metal, Rock, Punk, Beatbox

Code accompanying the NIPS 2017 paper [Generating Black Metal and Math Rock: Beyond
Bach, Beethoven, and Beatles](http://dadabots.com/nips2017/generating-black-metal-and-math-rock.pdf) and MUME 2018 paper [Generating Albums with SampleRNN to Imitate Metal, Rock, and Punk Bands](http://musicalmetacreation.org/buddydrive/file/carr/)

We modified a SampleRNN architecture to generate music in modern genres such as black metal, math rock, skate punk, beatbox, etc

This early example of neural synthesis is a proof-of-concept for how machine learning can drive new types of music software. Creating music can be as simple as specifying a set of music influences on which a model trains. We demonstrate a method for generating albums that imitate bands in experimental music genres previously unrealized by traditional synthesis techniques
(e.g. additive, subtractive, FM, granular, concatenative). Unlike MIDI and symbolic models, SampleRNN generates raw audio in the time domain. This requirement becomes increasingly important in modern music styles where timbre and space are used compositionally. Long developmental compositions with rapid transitions between sections are possible by increasing the depth of the network beyond the number used for speech datasets. We are delighted by the unique characteristic artifacts of neural synthesis.

We've created[ several albums](https://dadabots.bandcamp.com/) this way. Read our papers for more expalnation of how we use this as part of a creative workflow, how to choose good datasets, etc.

# SampleRNN (Dadabots fork)

Original SampleRNN paper [SampleRNN: An Unconditional End-to-End Neural Audio Generation Model](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkxKPDv5xl). 

## Features
- Load a dataset of audio
- Train a model on that audio to predict "given what just happened, what comes next?"
- Generate new audio by iteratively choosing "what next comes" indefinitely 

## Modifications from original code:
- Auto-preprocessing (audio conversion, concatenation, chunking, and saving .npy files). We find splitting an album into 32 00 overlapping chunks of 8 seconds to give us good results. 
- New scripts for generating 100s of audio examples in parallel from a trained net.
- New scripts for different sample rates are available (16k, 32k). 32k audio sounds better, but the nets take longer to train, and they don't learn structure as well as 16k.
- Any processed datasets can be loaded into the two-tier network via arguments. This significantly speeds up the workflow without having to change code. 
- Sampling is picked from distribution (not argmax). This makes better sense because certain sounds (noise, texture, the "s" sound in speech) are inherently stochastic. Also this is significant for avoiding traps (the generated audio gets stuck in a loop). 
- Wny number of RNN layers is now possible (until you run out of memory). This was significant to getting good results. The original limit was insufficient for music, we get good results with 5 layers. 
- Local conditioning. Although we haven't fully researched the possibilities of local conditioning, we coded it in. 
- Fix bad amplitude normalization causing DC offsets (see [issue](https://github.com/soroushmehr/sampleRNN_ICLR2017/issues/24)) 

## Dependencies

The original code lists:
- cuDNN 5105
- Python 2.7.12
- Numpy 1.11.1
- Theano 0.8.2 
- Lasagne 0.2.dev1
- ffmpeg (libav-tools)

But we get much faster code using the next generation of GPU architecture with:
- CUDA 9.2
- cuDNN 8.0
- Theano 1.0
- NVIDIA V100 GPU

## Setup

A detailed description of how we setup this code on Ubuntu 16.04 with NVIDIA 100 GPU can be found here.

## Datasets
To create a new dataset, place your audio here:
```
datasets/music/downloads/
```
then run the new experiment python script located in the datasets/music directory:

16k sample rate: 
```
cd datasets/music/
sudo python new_experiment16k.py krallice downloads/
```

32k sample rate: 
```
cd datasets/music/
sudo python new_experiment32k.py krallice downloads/
```

## Training
To train a model on an existing dataset with accelerated GPU processing, you need to run following lines from the root of `dadabots_sampleRNN` folder which corresponds to the best found set of hyper-paramters.

If you're using cuda9 with v100 gpus, you need "device=cuda0" 

If you're using cuda8 with K80 gpus or earlier, you may need "device=gpu0" instead

If you have 8 GPUs, you can run up to 8 experiments in parallel, by setting device to cuda0, cuda1, cuda2, cuda3... cuda7


#### Our best hyperparameters

After training 100s of models with different hyperparameters, these were our best hyperparameters (at the limits of the V100 hardware) for the kind of music we wanted to generate. Further explanation for our choices can be found in our papers.

```


### Training SampleRNN (3-tier)

There's also a 3-tier option, but we initially had better results with 2-tier, so we don't use 3-tier. It doesn't have the modifications we made to 2-tier.

                        linear layers (except for the embedding layer)
  --emb_size EMB_SIZE   Size of embedding layer (> 0)

                        Add skip connections to RNN

                        Should be 256 for mu-law.
  --q_type {linear,a-law,mu-law}
                        Quantization in linear-scale, a-law-companding, or mu-
                        law compandig. With mu-/a-law quantization level shoud
                        be set as 256
  --which_set WHICH_SET
                        any preprocessed set in the datasets/music/ directory
  --batch_size {64,128,256}
                        size of mini-batch

  --resume              Resume the same model from the last checkpoint. Order
                        of params are important. [for now]
```
To run:
```
$ THEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=cuda0,floatX=float32 python -u models/three_tier/three_tier.py --exp 3TIER --seq_len 512 --big_frame_size 8 --frame_size 2 --emb_size 256 --skip_conn False --dim 1024 --n_rnn 1 --rnn_type GRU --q_levels 256 --q_type linear --batch_size 128 --weight_norm True --learn_h0 True --which_set MUSIC

```

## Generating

Generate 100 songs (4 minutes each) from a trained 32k model:
```
$ THEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=gpu0,floatX=float32 python -u models/two_tier/two_tier_generate32k.py --exp krallice_experiment --n_frames 64 --frame_size 16 --emb_size 256 --skip_conn True --dim 1024 --n_rnn 5 --rnn_type LSTM --q_levels 256 --q_type mu-law --batch_size 128 --weight_norm True --learn_h0 False --which_set krallice --n_secs 240 --n_seqs 100
```

All the parameters have to be the same as when you trained it. Notice we're calling `two_tier_generate32k.py` with two new flags `--n_secs` and `--n_seqs` 

It will take just as much time to generate 100 songs as 5, because they are created in parallel (up to a hardware memory limit). 

This will generate from the latest checkpoint. However, we found the latest checkpoint does not always create the best music. Instead we listen to the test audio generated at each checkpoint, choose our favorite checkpoint, and delete the newer checkpoints, before generating a huge batch with this script. 


## Creative Workflow

At this point, we suggest human curation. Listen through the generated audio, find the best parts, and use them in your music. Read our [MUME 2018 paper](http://musicalmetacreation.org/buddydrive/file/carr/) to see how our workflow changed over the course of six albums.
