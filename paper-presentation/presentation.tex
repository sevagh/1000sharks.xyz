	Dimensionality of recognizeable audio features (notes, melodies, utterances) is more compact \footfullcite{samplernn}

\note{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
			We discard the phase component when analyzing audio, because it is not informative for most of the things we could be interested in. phase is very important because it meaningfully affects our perception \textbf{when generating sound}. phase hard because
			\begin{itemize}
			\item
				it is an angle between 0 and 2pi and wraps around (princarg)
			\item
				it becomes effectively random as the magnitude tends towards 0, because noise starts to dominate;
			\item
				absolute phase is less meaningful, but relative phase differences over time matter perceptually.
			\end{itemize}
		\item
			Counterpoint is that modeling the waveform domain implicitly preserves phase information, perceptually important
		\item
			Counterpoint is that the waveform needs hundres of thousands of samples for simple audio features -- from the sampleRNN paper, one of the primary methods i'll be introducing today

	Automatic music generation dates back to more than half a century. A prominent approach is to generate music symbolically in the form of a piano roll, which specifies the timing, pitch, velocity, and instrument of each note to be played. This has led to impressive results like producing Bach chorals, polyphonic music with multiple instruments, as well as minute long musical pieces.\\
	But symbolic generators have limitations -- they cannot capture human voices or many of the more subtle timbres, dynamics, and expressivity that are essential to music.\footfullcite{jukebox1}

	\frametitle{Sound synthesis -- wavetables and sinusoidal oscillators}
	Wavetable synthesis is perhaps the oldest technique for creating sounds with computers. It involves \textbf{the storage of a single period of a periodic waveform} in a circular buffer. By varying the ``speed'' with which a read pointer is advanced through the buffer, one can achieve output waveforms of different frequencies \footfullcite{3071}.\\\ \\
	Sound synthesis algorithms are typically described and implemented using primitive signal processing ``building blocks'' called \textbf{unit generators}. Create complex synthesis by combining multiple oscillators (see next page) \footfullcite{3072}, \footfullcite{3073}, \footfullcite{3074}.

			Can simulate more complex sound with multiple wavetables, envelopes, unit generators, oscillators.
		\item
			So, the computer is not \textit{creating} a new waveform -- it's modifying one already supplied to create outputs with different frequencies.
		\item
			Similarly, sine wave generators generate a simple basic waveform on which operations are applied and combined to create complex sounds
		\item
			Or using FFT synthesis (summation of sines)
		\item
			We're either using an existing waveform or combining simple waveforms, through frequency domain principles, to generate complex waveforms

\note{
\begin{quote}
	 In 1967, Chowning realized that complex sounds could be generated using only two oscillators when the output of one oscillator is connected to the frequency input of a second oscillator. Essentially, the first oscillator generates a pure tone that modulates the frequency of the second oscillator in a way that produces a complex tone, like a string vibrating.

	\frametitle{Neural audio synthesis}
	\begin{quote}
		The question of generating musical signals has been extensively studied over the past decades. Most of the previous approaches on this topic were \textbf{defined in the spectral domain as a complex set of relatively simple manipulation (subtractive, additive or modulation synthesis)}. However, several recent breakthroughs in audio waveform generative models based on neural networks (Oord, 2016 \textbf{WaveNet}) have obtained astounding results in speech synthesis both qualitatively and quantitatively (Mehri, 2016 \textbf{SampleRNN}). These systems rely on learning the structure of audio waveforms directly from a given set of audio files, without computing a spectral transform and in an unsupervised manner.\footfullcite{intro1}
	\end{quote}

\note{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
			In traditional synthesis we create complex waveforms by combining simple ones
		\item
			In 2018, we have the computational power and models to make sense of the waveform directly

	\frametitle{WaveNet}
	Concatenative TTS: database of short speech fragments recombined to form complete utterances\\\ \\

	Parameteric TTS: information to generate data is stored as model parameters, contents and characteristics of speech are controlled via model inputs. Parametric models generate audio through vocoders -- sound less natural than concatenative\\\ \\

	WaveNet changes this paradigm by directly modelling the raw waveform of the audio signal, one sample at a time. As well as yielding more natural-sounding speech, using raw waveforms means that WaveNet can model any kind of audio, including music. \footfullcite{wavenet}, \footfullcite{wavenetpaper}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{SampleRNN}
	Use RNNs to learn long-term patterns:\\
	\begin{quote}
		raw audio signals are challenging to model because they contain structure at very different scales: correlations exist between neighboring samples as well as between ones thousands of samples apart. SampleRNN helps to address this challenge by using a hierarchy of modules, each operating at a different temporal resolution.\footfullcite{samplernn}
	\end{quote}
	Contrast with WaveNet dilations:
	\begin{quote}
		In order to deal with long-range temporal dependencies needed for raw audio generation, we develop new architectures based on dilated causal convolutions\footfullcite{wavenet}
	\end{quote}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{What's an RNN}
	Recurrent neural networks:
	\begin{quote}
		Recurrent neural networks, also known as RNNs, are a class of neural networks that allow previous outputs to be used as inputs while having hidden states.\footfullcite{rnn}
	\end{quote}\\
	So, it generates samples at a micro-temporal scale (like WaveNet) for realistic timbre/notes, and then the generated samples feed back into the network which has also learned macro-temporal patterns (e.g. how notes follow other notes), to generate audio which exhibits patterns at multiple temporal scales.\\
\end{frame}

\note{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
			 Different scales of patterns -- that's music exactly
		 \item
			 The main insight behind SampleRNN is that audio in particular exhibits salient patterns at multiple timescales, and that these patterns and features are composed hierarchically. For example, timbre is shaped by patterns over very short timescales, while musical events and gestures like bowing or striking an instrument happen over longer timescales. Melodies are composed of a series of musical events, which are often grouped into compositional structures like bars or phrases, which are further grouped into sections and then full songs. (Karl Hiner)
	\end{itemize}
}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{SampleRNN diagram}
	Note how similar it is to WaveNet. WaveNet ``dilates'' the convolutions to go from a small time step to a large one  -- SampleRNN ``upsamples'' the vector to bump up the temporal resolution

		\caption{How SampleRNN computes samples of output y[n] from historical samples \{x[n], x[n-1], ...\}}

\note{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
			For me, dilation (spreading out the input signal) is the same as upsampling (spreading out the input signal)
		\item
			Notice how the diagram shows the broad similarity in their architecture

	Referring to WaveNet generated speech quality:
	\begin{quote}
		Unconditional generation from this model manifests as ``babbling'' due to the lack of longer term structure\footfullcite{wavenetcrit1}
	\end{quote}\\\ \\
	Referring to WaveNet and SampleRNN listening experiments trained on classical and techno music:
	\begin{quote}
		we first compare the related audio file sets of both experiments. After listening to the music samples, we conclude that none of the four sets contain audio that even slightly resembles music. The files generally sound noisy and random.\footfullcite{wavenetcrit2}
	\end{quote}
\end{frame}

\note{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
			WaveNet and SampleRNN are good at learning on a micro-temporal level (up to individual instrument onsets, notes, timbres). Needs further conditioning to enforce longer-term structure (melody, song structure, etc.)
		\item
			Incoherent medium/longer-term structure:
		\item
			In that first paper, they start discussing ways of training WaveNet by enforcing longer-term structure

\note{
	This is my project idea. It'll be heavier on the literature -- I'll need to deep dive to understand the innards of the machine learning/neural networks, but it's too soon to do a significant contribution or novel work -- I'm new to machine learning. I want to create a fake artist with fake music using one or many machine learning-based approaches.

	\frametitle{Towards structure}
	Jukebox\footfullcite{jukebox1}, \footfullcite{jukebox2} addresses the long input problem with an autoencoder that compresses raw audio to a lower-dimensional space by discarding perceptually irrelevant information. Then trains a model to generate audio in this compressed space, and upsample back to the raw audio space.\\
	\vspace{0.5em}
	Tacotron 2\footfullcite{tacotron21}, \footfullcite{tacotron22} uses an 80-dimensional audio spectrogram with frames computed every 12.5 milliseconds to capture not only pronunciation of words, but also various subtleties of human speech, including volume, speed and intonation. These features are converted to a waveform using a WaveNet-like architecture.
\end{frame}

\note{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
			Note the 2 ways of dealing with wavenet shortcomings
		\item
			Jukebox relies on operating on a compressed version of the waveform, so it can become computationally feasible to learn longer-term (minutes) musical structure. Opens itself up to suffering from imperfect recreation - e.g. Griffin-Lim phase reconstruction
		\item
			Tactron 2 combines spectral features for long-term structure (utterances, words) and wavenet for the synthesis to the waveform. Best of both worlds

\note{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
			Differentiability is not new. Relevant in many forms of numerical computation e.g. fem. Just very generalized in neural networks
		\item
			``Differentiable'' -- machine learning is often done with gradients -- gradient descent. The machine ``learns'' by reducing the error through the gradient. As DSP building blocks are differentiable, they can thus be machine learned (or more accurately, parameters can be estimated, and from the differentiability, the resulting quality improvement can be measured e.g. compared to a real violin sound).

		\item
			Advantages include learning realistic timbre, dynamics, intonations, etc. directly from the waveform. No reconstruction problems
		\item
			Disadvantages include unstructured/unreliable outputs, black box (difficult to understand) computational model
